CONTROLS:
  R = RESTART
  N = NEW MAZE
  D = DFS SEARCH
  B = BFS SEARCH
  K = TOGGLE ANIMATION OF MAZE CONSTRUCTION (KNOCKING DOWN OF WALLS)
  
**TO COMPARE BFS AND DFS, PERFORM ONE, PRESS R, THEN PERFORM THE OTHER**

**THE ACTUAL CODE HERE IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT VERY USER-FRIENDLY, HOWEVER A DEMO
  .JAR FILE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROGRAM ON A 50x50 MAZE.**
